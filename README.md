## 
Elbow Curve and Cluster Analysis 
Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of clustering performance using Elbow Curve methods and the comparison of clustering results between original data and PCA-transformed data. The main objectives are to:

Visualize and compare Elbow Curves to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Compare clustering results using bar charts to evaluate differences between original and PCA-transformed datasets.

## Data Sources
I referenced the class activities for guidance on completing the project. However, I could not figure out how to create a composite to compare results. Advice is much appreciated. 
I also used ChatGpt to try an dproblem solve, but it did not resolve my issue.
